# üóÇÔ∏è In-Memory Virtual Filesystem (Java CLI)

## üöÄ Overview

This is a command-line based **virtual filesystem built entirely in memory using Java**. It mimics a real Linux-like shell and supports navigation, file creation, directory management, and more ‚Äî all without any disk I/O.

The goal is to **understand how filesystems and shell commands work under the hood**, and to gain hands-on experience with object-oriented design and command interpreters.

## üßæ Problem Statement

Design and implement a **fully in-memory virtual filesystem** that supports standard shell-like commands to manipulate directories and files.
